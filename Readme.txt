I'm going to start adding stock photos in the images folder.

Sorry... git was being a jerk and wouldn't sync for whatever reasons.  I got an assets folder created and threw a bunch of stuff in it.

I also found a great template to run with if you need any inspiration... his site will have a lot less content though.
